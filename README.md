# STAR-WARS-react
This is a RESTful single page application that uses JSON-server to GET and POST data for charaters from the STAR WARS saga. 

This app will be useful to someone who wants to add data for searchable Star Wars characters. The data appears as character cards. Cards can be easiy added and deleted, updating a db.json based server. 

On the front page the user has the option to View Characters, Add New Characters, or view the About Page.
